# The Magic Memory Game!

**A classic memory game to sharpen your mind with a few clicks!**

I built this card matching memory game project while following along with a [The Net Ninja on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCKohZwGZMw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iQ7g2eoNXHCJBBBz40S_Lm&index=1) tutorial.

## Installation

This project was built in React.
Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.
The project runs with the npm run start command.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Runs the project in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to play:

1. Flip over a card and try to remember its location.
2. Flip over another card to see if they are a match. If they do, you get a point, otherwise they both flip back over.

Try to match all the cards with the fewest number of turns possible!

**Good Luck!**
